The Data Encryption and Decryption Tool is a Java application designed for secure text and file encryption using a combination of RSA and AES algorithms. This user-friendly tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing, making it accessible to users without extensive technical knowledge.

Features
Text Encryption and Decryption: Easily encrypt and decrypt text messages securely.
File Encryption and Decryption: Encrypt and decrypt files using robust RSA and AES algorithms.
Simple and Intuitive Interface: The GUI simplifies the encryption and decryption process, making it user-friendly.
Getting Started
To use the tool, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Clone the repository, compile the Java code, and create an executable JAR file. The tool supports both text and file encryption, providing a versatile solution for securing sensitive information.

Usage
Run the application using the JAR file and utilize the straightforward GUI to perform various encryption and decryption tasks. Encrypt text, decrypt text, encrypt files, and decrypt files seamlessly with just a few clicks.
